# Web Testing for Beginners

In this repository, I would like to share with you some of the testing techniques you will use in your web development. There are plenty of third libraries and tools can help you to test your code, such as `Jest`, `Mocha`, `Chai`, `Karma`, `Jasmine`, `Cypress`, `Enzyme`, `Pupeeter` and `React-testing-library` (why so many üò≠). But now, I just want to focus on some basic knowledge and techniques, so I chose `Jest`, `React-testing-library`, and `Cypress` to share with you.

## Jest

[‚ù§Ô∏è Move here to learn complete Jest testing skills ‚ù§Ô∏è](jest-beginner/)

In this section, we will practice some basic testing methods in Jest.

1. **Matchers** - Implementing the fundamental test process
2. **Asynchronous** - Implementing asynchronous code testing
3. **Setup** - Implementing `setup` and `dispose` code before/after tests 
4. **Mock** - Simulating side effects to focus on testing core code

## React-testing-library

TBD.

## Cypress

TBD.
